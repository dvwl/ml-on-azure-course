## Module 17: Create and Understand Regression Model with Python

In this exercise, youâ€™ll dive into the world of regression models in machine learning using Python. Through practical exercises, you'll gain insights into various regression techniques and their applications in predictive modeling.

### Exercise Overview

In this module, you will learn:

- Work with new algorithms: Linear regression, multiple linear regression, and polynomial regression.
- Understand the strengths and limitations of regression models.
- Visualize error and cost functions in linear regression.
- Understand basic evaluation metrics for regression.

This module provides a comprehensive introduction to regression modeling, allowing you to explore different algorithms, understand their underlying principles, and evaluate their performance.

### Jupyter Notebooks

To get started, access the following Jupyter notebooks:

1. [Training a Simple Linear Regression Model](../notebook/17/1-exercise-train-linear-regression.ipynb) - Learn the fundamentals of linear regression by training a simple linear regression model on a dataset with one predictor variable.
2. [Training a Multiple Linear Regression Model](../notebook/17/2-exercise-multiple-linear-regression.ipynb) - Extend your knowledge to multiple linear regression by training a model on a dataset with multiple predictor variables.
3. [Polynomial Regression](../notebook/17/3-exercise-polynomial-regression.ipynb) - Explore polynomial regression, a technique to capture non-linear relationships between variables, by training a model on polynomial features.

These notebooks will guide you through practical exercises where you'll apply regression algorithms, visualize model performance, and gain a deeper understanding of regression techniques in machine learning.

Happy learning!

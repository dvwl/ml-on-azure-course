## Module 2: Getting Started with Azure AI Services

In Module 2, you'll kickstart your journey with Azure AI Services by creating an Azure AI Services resource in your Azure subscription and utilizing it from a client application. The primary goal of this exercise is to familiarize yourself with a general pattern for provisioning and working with Azure AI services as a developer. Whether you prefer C# or Python, you'll have the opportunity to engage with the Azure AI Services.

### Explore Azure AI Module

To begin your exploration of Azure AI Services, we recommend diving into the module provided by Microsoft Learning:

- **Azure AI Services:** [Getting Started with Azure AI Services](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-ai-services/Instructions/Exercises/01-use-azure-ai-services.html)

This module offers a hands-on experience in provisioning Azure AI resources and demonstrates how to interact with them from a client application using either C# or Python. While the focus is not on gaining expertise in any particular service, you'll gain valuable insights into the development workflow and best practices for integrating Azure AI Services into your projects.

### Next Steps

After completing Module 2, you'll be equipped with the foundational knowledge to start building intelligent applications using Azure AI Services. Stay tuned for further modules where we'll explore advanced AI capabilities and real-world use cases.

Happy coding!

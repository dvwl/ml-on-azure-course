## Module 7: Explore Classification with Azure Machine Learning Designer

In this exercise, you will explore the realm of classification using Azure Machine Learning Designer. Specifically, you will train a classification model to predict whether an individual has diabetes or not based on relevant features.

### Explore Classification 

To deepen your understanding of classification modeling and its application in Azure Machine Learning Designer, we recommend exploring the following module provided by Microsoft Learning:

- **Classification with Azure Machine Learning Designer:** [Classification with Azure Machine Learning Designer](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/AI-900-AIFundamentals/instructions/02b-create-classification-model.html)

This module covers a variety of topics including the fundamentals of classification algorithms, techniques for data preprocessing, model training and evaluation, and deployment of classification models in Azure Machine Learning. By completing this module, you'll gain valuable insights into building and deploying classification models for real-world scenarios.

### Exercise Overview

In this exercise, you'll delve into the process of training a classification model in Azure Machine Learning. Using a dataset containing relevant medical information, including features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, and body mass index (BMI), you'll follow a series of steps to preprocess the data, select appropriate features, train the classification model, and evaluate its performance in predicting diabetes.

### Key Learning Objectives

- Understand the principles of classification modeling and its application in predictive analytics.
- Learn how to preprocess data and select relevant features for classification analysis.
- Gain practical experience in training and evaluating classification models using Azure Machine Learning Designer.

### Next Steps

After completing this exercise, you'll have developed the skills and knowledge necessary to train and deploy classification models in Azure Machine Learning. Stay tuned for upcoming modules where we'll explore advanced machine learning techniques and applications.

Happy modeling!

## Module 8: Training a Clustering Model in Azure Machine Learning

In this exercise, you will explore the fascinating world of clustering using Azure Machine Learning. Specifically, you will train a clustering model to classify various penguin species based on their physical characteristics.

### Explore Clustering Modeling Module

To deepen your understanding of clustering modeling and its application in Azure Machine Learning Designer, we recommend exploring the following module provided by Microsoft Learning:

- **Clustering with Azure Machine Learning Designer:** [Clustering with Azure Machine Learning Designer](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/AI-900-AIFundamentals/instructions/02c-create-clustering-model.html)

This module covers a variety of topics including the fundamentals of clustering algorithms, techniques for data preprocessing, model training and evaluation, and deployment of clustering models in Azure Machine Learning Designer. By completing this module, you'll gain valuable insights into building and deploying clustering models for real-world scenarios.

### Exercise Overview

In this exercise, you'll delve into the process of training a clustering model in Azure Machine Learning Designer. Using a dataset containing physical characteristics of various penguin species, such as culmen length, flipper length, and body mass, you'll follow a series of steps to preprocess the data, select appropriate features, train the clustering model, and evaluate its performance in classifying penguin species into distinct clusters.

### Key Learning Objectives

- Understand the principles of clustering modeling and its application in pattern recognition and grouping.
- Learn how to preprocess data and select relevant features for clustering analysis.
- Gain practical experience in training and evaluating clustering models using Azure Machine Learning Designer.

### Next Steps

After completing this exercise, you'll have developed the skills and knowledge necessary to train and deploy clustering models in Azure Machine Learning. Stay tuned for upcoming modules where we'll explore advanced machine learning techniques and applications.

Happy clustering!
